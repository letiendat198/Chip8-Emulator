# Chip8-Emulator

A Chip8 emulator written for experience purpose

## How to use
- Download the executable from [Release](https://github.com/letiendat198/Chip8-Emulator/release/latest)
- Place the rom you want to load as **rom.ch8** in the same folder as the executable

## Known Issues
- Disp.wait test not passing (So things will load too fast instead of supposed 60Hz)
- No sound
- Some games will break or behave weirdly

## TODO
- Fix Disp.wait
- Add sound
- Add support for SCHIP and XO-CHIP
